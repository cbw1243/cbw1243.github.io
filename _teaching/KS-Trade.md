This course was instructed by Dr. Nelson Villoria, and I was teaching assistant of this course for two times. I was responsible for providing assistance in grading, designing homeworks, making exam questions, and student tutoring. I also gave guest lectures on exchange rates and trade policy. My teaching evaluation from students was 4.6 out of 5.
