This article explains inverse probability weighting with a few R codes. It is published at <em>The Startup</em>. 

<em>Preview</em>: Inverse Probability Weighting (IPW) is a popular quasi-experimental statistical method for estimating causal effects under the assumption of conditional independence. This method can be easily implemented and easy to understand. In this post, I will provide an explanation of this method with minimal R codes.
