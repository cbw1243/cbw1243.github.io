Hi, welcome to my website! I am Bowen Chen, a postdoctoral scholar at the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. I earned my PhD in Agricultural Economics at Kansas State University in 2019.  

My research areas are international trade and production economics. I work predominantly on applied research at the intersection of international trade, development, and the environment. My current research seeks to understand the roles of international trade and conservation practices in mitigating the climate change impacts on the global agriculture. I also have particular interests in policy issues concerning agricultural trade between the U.S. and China.
