I was instructor of this course. This course was aimed at equipping students entering into economics graduate programs with knowledge in maths and programming that can help with their graduate studies. I splitted the course into two parts. The first part covers calculus and linear algebra; the second part covers R, STATA, and SAS. I was responsible for teaching the first part and R in the second part. I invited two of my colleagues to teach STATA and SAS. My teaching evaluation from students was 4.8 out of 5.
