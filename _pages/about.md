Hi! I am Bowen, a postdoctoral scholar at the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics at the University of Illinois. I was trained as an agricultural economist at the Kansas State University and earned my PhD degree there in 2019. 

My research fields are **_international trade_** and **_production economics_**. I work predominantly on applied research at the intersection of international trade, international development, agricultural policy, and the environment. My current research seeks to understand how international trade and conservation practices can mitigate the climate change impacts on the global agriculture. I have dealt extensively with fine-scale geospatial and temporal data with applications of modern statistical and econometric models and data science tools.
