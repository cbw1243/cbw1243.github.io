## Research Project 1 

### Objective & Methodology   

This research seeks to understand the impacts of conservation practices on crop yields and crop profitability in the U.S. To do the research, we use remotely sensed tillage data and Agricultural Resource Management Survey data in combination with casual inference models. This research is funded by the Natural Resources Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

## Research Project 2 

### Objective & Methodology   

This research investigates the effects of maize yield shocks in exporting countries in intra-annual maize price variability in the developing and food-importing countries. To do the research, we use historical data on domestic maize prices and maize yields sourced from the Food Agricultural Organization. We explore within-country and-market variations in the data to understand how yield shocks contribute to the intra-annual maize price variability.
